    The first day of Anti-Valentine's Week is Slap Day, and it begins a day after Valentine's Day on February 15. 
    This day is for people who want to slap their ex who cheated on them or gave them heartbreak. However, 
    we do not mean that you should literally slap them. Instead, 
    it's the perfect opportunity to slap the feelings for those people away and move ahead in life.
